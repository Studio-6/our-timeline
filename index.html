      Inprov AI was an artificial intelligence music software engine beta that allowed musicians and composers to easily create new and unique music. It works by first translating MIDI data, which is a standardized format for digital music, into a style model. The Inprov AI engine then uses this style model as a basis to compose original music that is influenced by the input style. It enables user to generate new tracks with similar characteristics of the input making it easy to create orignal music that aligns with a certain style and taste with the help of AI.
